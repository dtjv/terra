# terra ðŸŒ±

A web application for a garden center.

> This project is for demonstration purposes only. It is a work-in-progress.

## Delivery ðŸšš

Garden centers may offer delivery of bark yard products. These deliveries are
often scheduled by appointment and billed by travel distance to the customer's
address.

This project is my web-based concept to create and manage delivery orders. The
software solution is primarily intended to eliminate paper-based scheduling
errors.
